Mint engine project

#### Set Up
click the GeneralProject.bat inside the script folder  
the solution mode may not work because of the vspkg I used is not automatically installed
You can check the relase zip to play with the v0.0.9 version of Mint.

### option
if you want to use run the solution then please do the following.
On windows, use vcpkg and install openal-soft, mpg123, libflac and libogg (you'll probably want the :x64-windows versions). Integrate vcpkg with Visual Studio with vcpkg integrate install if you haven't already, and the solution file should build.
